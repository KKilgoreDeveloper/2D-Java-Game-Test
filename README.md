# 2D-Java-Game-Test

Hello! This is my attempt at learning to make a 2D game using Java!
After the basic controls and functions are added, I plan on modifying and updating the project
to add my own unique ideas and flare and hopefully create something neat!

Controls so far:

-Use WASD to move player character

-P: Pause

Current Functions:

-REMOVED Objects, will likely be added later (so no more object interactions for now)

-Can walk around

-npc interaction and dialogue will be added soon

Removed/Disabled Functions:

Could pick up keys to open entrances (tho they're curtains instead of doors so doesn't really make sense so far, but whatever)
